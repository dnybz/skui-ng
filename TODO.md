# The big Skui To Do list

This contains a list of "immediate" To Do's, which should roughly be implemented first.

## Miscellaneous

- Find a better library name

## Core

 - Per thread event queue
 - Signals to trigger slots in certain thread
 - Commandline handling (in application?)
 - Unicode string
 - File system API (largely based on std::filesystem)
 - resource system (no precompile step if at all anywhere possible.

## GUI

 - Create library
 - abstract OS event loop
 - create window class
 - drawing primitives (basic text, shapes)
 - basic "layout"/"widget" system
 - think about DPI and screen size awareness in the drawing and layouting system
 - image file format support (png/jpg/bmp/svg/pdf/eps/...)


## Other components

 - network (http, websockets, etc.)
 - loads, and loads of other stuff I haven't thought about.
